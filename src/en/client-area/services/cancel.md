# Cancelling a service
<span style="opacity:0.8;">We're sorry to hear that you are considering to cancel your service. We of course understand if you'd like to cancel your subscription, since everything does not always go as planned or life situation just changes.</span>

We would like to have an notice about the cancellation - as it eases our job. We do not usually send our invoices to debt collection when wervices are paid on pre-term basis, but if you pay your services after using them, we do send the invoices to debt collections (usually only businesses).

## Immediate cancellation
If you choose immendiate cancellation, the service is cancelled immediately and deleted from our servers. This means that you will not be able to access the service anymore and all files are deleted from our servers.

## Paypal subscriptions
Keep in mind that you do have to cancel your PayPal subscription manually if you have created automatic payment profile. This usually works through our client area by clicking "Cancel" button on service details page, but we recommend to check the subscription status from PayPal as well (since it have not always been working as expected).

## Partial refunds
If you have chosen to cancel the service immediately, we can refund the remaining time of your service, but we will not refund the time you have already used. To receive the refund, you need to contact our customer support.
