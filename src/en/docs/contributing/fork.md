# Forking

If you have more time on your hands and would like to contribute to the documentation, you can fork the documentation and make changes to it. Forking can be done through GitHub, where you can create a branch, make edits, and submit the changes for review.

However, please keep in mind that this is Bittivirta's documentation, so the changes will be published only after they have been approved by Bittivirta's staff. For larger changes, it is advisable to first ask Bittivirta's staff if the changes are needed.

Additionally, the documentation is subject to Bittivirta's intellectual property rights, and the repository is licensed under a proprietary license. Therefore, the changes will become the property of Bittivirta once they are approved.

## Branching through GitHub

Create a branch using the Fork button on GitHub. When creating a new branch, use either the `feature/feature-name` or `fix/fix-name` format for the branch name. After making the changes, create a new pull request for the changes to be reviewed and approved.

Name the new branch as follows:

- `feature/feature-name` for adding a new feature
- `fix/fix-name` for fixing an issue

For example:

- `feature/new-minecraft-guide` for adding instructions on setting up a Minecraft server
- `fix/typos` for fixing typos

> ⚠️ **Do not make changes directly to the `main` branch!**

## Making Commits

When making commit messages, follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention and use [Gitmojis](https://gitmoji.dev/) to indicate the type of change. Each commit should have a title, emoji, and description. The title should start with one of the following words:

- `fix`: for fixing an issue
- `feat`: for adding a new feature

The emoji indicates the type of change and should be added at the beginning of the title. Some examples of emojis are:

- `:bug:` for fixing an issue
- `:sparkles:` for adding a new feature
- `:pencil2:` for fixing a typo
- `:recycle:` for reorganizing instructions

The description may include the following:

- Fixing a typo
- Correcting incorrect information
- Fixing a broken link
- Adding new content

## Submitting Changes

Once you have made the changes, you can submit them for review. Before submitting the changes, make sure to update your branch with the latest version from the main branch. After that, you can push the changes to GitHub and create a new pull request. The pull request title should follow the same formatting used for making commits. The pull request description should provide information about the changes made.
