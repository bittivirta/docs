## Finvoice

We prefer to receive invoices as Finnish e-invoices (Finvoice). Our Finvoice address is:

| Finvoice address  | Operator  | Broker ID    |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| 003728842701      | Apix      | 003723327487 |

## Email invoices

Invoices can also be sent by e-mail to `invoices@bittivirta.fi`. The invoice must be in PDF format and attached as a file. The invoice must contain all the information that would be on a Finnish e-invoice. The invoice must also contain a reference number so that the invoice can be recorded correctly.

::: danger If the invoice is not attached and in PDF format, it will not be recorded in our system and it will be ignored. We recommend sending invoices as Finnish e-invoices (Finvoice) instead.
