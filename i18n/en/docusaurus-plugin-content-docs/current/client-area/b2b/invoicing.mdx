# Invoicing

Normally, all Bittivirra orders are prepaid, i.e. the product is shipped or the service is activated only - after the invoice is paid. However, if you want to use the service immediately or your company requires invoicing, we can send an invoice to Finnish companies with a payment term of 14 days. An invoice surcharge of â‚¬10 + VAT 24% will be added to the invoice for work done manually.

You can access the invoicing by asking our customer service team. You can contact us via the chat window or by sending an email to :envelope: [support@bittivirta.fi](mailto:support@bittivirta.fi).
